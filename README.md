## A. GA Introduction
####The algorithm is started with _a set of solutions_ called *population*. Solutions from one population are taken and used to form a new population by _reproduction_ and _`crossover` with another_. Besides, There is a little rate of `mutation` in some popultations.

## B. Compile and Execute
	* The order of arguments when compiling is `executing times`, `nums of population`, `length of genes`, mutation rate` and `crossover rate`
	* Or you can use the file `compile.sh` to compile and execute
	eg. 
		$ chmod +x compile.sh
		$ ./compile.sh
